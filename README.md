# Actimagine-VX-Research

Tryna figure out this NDS video format, right now just a 010 template to start me off. Not currently taking into account audio as I'm working with files that don't have any audio tracks for simplicity.


Using documentation and notes from the following sources, thanks to the people who have previously attempted to look at it.

Tryna look for more resources to understand h.264 and mobiclip, I'll add more as I come across them!
